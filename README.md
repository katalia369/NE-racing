# NE-racing
In Cub Scouts, we have all these fun races like the Pinewood Derby and Rain Gutter Regatta. Leaders face the same challenge every year, How do we let each scout run as many races as possible, have fun without losing the crowd control, and still have a competitive winner?

In 1975 Mr. Marc Borom challenged a mathematician in his pack to make a better way, and the Stearns-Borom Method came to be. Since that time, there have also been developments in the math for Perfect-N and Partial Perfect-N. However, these charts and spreadsheets can be difficult to manage, and at an event, changes for no-show and last-minute registrations is a hassle at best. Because of this, most leaders have switched to double elimination brackets and have paid software that generates them. Although some manually create theirs or use free browser-based generators.

I know with today's technology and code languages, an app or simple program that runs on all devices (Windows, Apple, Linux, Android) is possible, but I do not have the skill in coding to make it happen. I hope that someone will find this project on the git and help make the idea a reality.

As I said before, several spreadsheets are running the algorithm, and I have uploaded a few here. I have also uploaded the one attempt by someone to convert the algorithm to a program back in the days of 16bit DOS. All the information is available online for free. All I did was bring it together here. Anything developed from it would be freeware with all due credit given to original authors and new coders.

The rules of the algorithm are as follows:
1) Each racer will run on each lane of the track the same number of times
2) Each racer will face every other racer the same number of races

The app specs are as follows:
1) Run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android
2) Allow an entry for the number of lanes available
3) Allow entry of scout names or registration numbers
4) Allow entry of place (first, second, etc.)
5) Add up a score based on place (first place 1 point, etc.)
6) Display or print the scores for leaders to declare run-offs or winners
